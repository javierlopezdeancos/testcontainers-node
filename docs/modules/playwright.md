## How to use

### Start a Playwright container

Playwright has official docker images in the [Microsoft Artifact Registry](https://mcr.microsoft.com/en-us/product/playwright/about) 
that you can review to choose a tag.

```typescript
import path from "path";
import { PlaywrightContainer } from "@testcontainers/playwright";

const PLAYWRIGHT_IMAGE = "mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.42.1-jammy";
const PLAYWRIGHT_PROJECT_TESTS_TO_RUN_INTO_THE_CONTAINER = path.resolve(__dirname, "..", "example-project");

const startedPlaywrightContainer = await new PlaywrightContainer(
    PLAYWRIGHT_IMAGE,
    PLAYWRIGHT_PROJECT_TESTS_TO_RUN_INTO_THE_CONTAINER
  ).start();
```

### Execute test in a Playwright container

```typescript
const { output, exitCode } = await startedPlaywrightBuildInReporterContainer.exec([
    "npx",
    "playwright",
    "test",
  ]);
```

### Reporter

Review the [Playwright reporter documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-reporters) in order to know the available reporters and how you can notify playwright which should be run and how.
Playwright has two different kind of reporters, the built-in reporters (line, dot) and the external reporters (html, json, junit, blob).
You can set which reporter and how to run it, configuring the `playwright.config.js` file in your project, or, in some cases, passing environment variables that can override this file configurations.
To extract the reporter generated by our tests, you can use the `saveReporter` method from the `PlaywrightContainer` class passing the type of reporter to extract and where do you want to extract it .

### Execute tests in a Playwright container and read the dot reporter output

```typescript
import path from "path";

const startedPlaywrightContainer = await new PlaywrightContainer(
    PLAYWRIGHT_IMAGE,
    PLAYWRIGHT_PROJECT_TESTS_TO_RUN_INTO_THE_CONTAINER
  ).start();

const { output, exitCode } = await startedPlaywrightBuildInReporterContainer.exec([
  "npx",
